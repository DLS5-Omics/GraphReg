# GraphReg

**GraphReg** ([Chromatin interaction aware gene regulatory modeling with graph attention networks] (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.437978v2.abstract)) is a gene regulation model which integrates DNA sequence, 1D epigenomic data (such as chromatin accessability and histone modifications), and 3D chromatin conformation data (such as Hi-C, HiChIP, Micro-C, HiCAR) to predict gene expression in an informative way.


This repository contains all the codes for training [GraphReg](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.437978v2.abstract) models and all the downstream analyses for gene expression prediction, enhancer validation, and the role of transcription factor (TF) motifs on regulating their target genes.
